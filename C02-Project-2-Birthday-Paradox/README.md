Birthday Paradox
========================================================
The Birthday Paradox, also called the Birthday Problem, is the surprisingly high
probability that two people will have the same birthday even in a small group of people.

print('''Birthday Paradox, by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com

The Birthday Paradox shows us that in a group of N people, the odds
that two of them have matching birthdays is surprisingly large.
This program does a Monte Carlo simulation (that is, repeated random
simulations) to explore this concept.

(It's not actually a paradox, it's just a surprising result.)
